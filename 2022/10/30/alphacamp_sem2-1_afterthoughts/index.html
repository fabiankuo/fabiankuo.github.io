It is designed to be completed within 4 weeks.</p><p>The course is divided into 5 modules:</p><ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Javascript Core Concepts</li><li>Website Layout and Techniques</li><li>DOM Manipulation and Event Handling</li><li>Recap Assignments</li><li>Final Assessments and Moving On</li></ul><p>There is an extra module on the topic of data structure, but isn&rsquo;t mandatory.</p><h2 id=afterthoughts>Afterthoughts</h2><h3 id=first-impressions>First Impressions</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve bought and completed several online courses. Although this is one of the most expensive ones by far, the learning experience is unparalleled.</p><p>My favorite part about Alpha Camp (AC) is their introduction modules. They give a really well rounded overview of the course and provide learning suggestions. The recommended books and online courses are all really good and they even provide a brief overview of the key concepts for those that don&rsquo;t have enough time to go through the recommended materials in detail.</p><p>AC stresses the importance of developing a problem solving mindset above all else. I strongly agree with them. All these programming languages, frameworks, libraries, etc are all just tools for solving problems. None of them are as important as the person wielding the tools. This is something that I&rsquo;ve learned and experienced throughout my years as a backend web developer.</p><p>The course is really well structured and the assignments are designed to reinforce the main theme of each module. Feedbacks are plenty and the interaction with the teacher&rsquo;s aid (ta) and peers is great. I was able to get a lot of suggestions and inspirations from them.</p><h3 id=adjustment-cycle>Adjustment Cycle</h3><p>At the end of each week, we are asked to write an ORID report to summarize, reflect, interpret, and make adjustments to our learning pattern. This proved to be a game changer. Each week, I would reflect on how effective or ineffective my learning methods were and make adjustments accordingly during the upcoming week.</p><p>This reflection and adjustment cycle helped me develop the habit of waking up at 04:00 a.m. everyday to study. I also came to the conclusion of limiting each study session to around 70-80 minutes. This was the result of weeks of testing and adjustment.</p><h3 id=power-of-community>Power of Community</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve been learning on my own ever since my career transition. The main difference between my past learning experience and that of AC is community support. Before, I would buy an online course and plow through it on my own. I would set a deadline for myself and promise to reward myself if I finished the course on time. But at AC, I&rsquo;ve come across other learners who are very motivated, self-disciplined, and willing to share their learning experiences.</p><p>The interaction amongst peers is also eye opening. There are assignments that must be turned in for each module and we are able to view and comment on our peers&rsquo; submitted assignments. A lot of the students would comment on submitted assignments, giving suggestions or making inquiries. The comments sections can become quite lively sometimes.</p><h3 id=teachers-aid-and-learning-coach>Teacher&rsquo;s Aid and Learning Coach</h3><p>AC offers teacher&rsquo;s aid (ta) and learning coach support for each individual learner. Some assignments are labeled as key skill evaluation assignments, these are the assignments are graded and feedbacks are provided. The feedbacks generally contain insights and suggestions, all that I&rsquo;ve found to be quite helpful.</p><p>At the end of each week, I would receive a weekly recap and progress overview from my learning coach. The contents would range from suggestions to words of encouragement. If need be, each student can contact their learning coach for learning advice or general counseling. I haven&rsquo;t requested any counseling sessions, but some peers have shared their counseling experiences and couldn&rsquo;t recommend it enough.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>I had my first taste of vanilla javascript back in 2016 on my first job as a backend web developer. I had been learning to code in C# for the past 5 months prior to the job and transitioning to javascript was a terrible experience for me. The project lasted a month and I never spared another glance at javascript since then. That is, until I started this frontend course in AC.</p><p>Completing this course changed my view and opinion on javascript completely. I&rsquo;ve begun enjoying coding in javascript and appreciating its quirkiness. The course is structured in a way that it doesn&rsquo;t delve too deeply, but instead provides just enough information for beginners to process and complete the corresponding assignments. AC also provides supplementary sources for more seasoned coders that want to dive deeper on the topics covered. As a result, I spent a lot more time then I had planned.</p><p>I am really looking forward to semester 2-2.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><p class=post-tags><span>Tagged:</span>
