Today, I&rsquo;ll be going over the content of semester 2-2.</p><p>Semester 2-2 focuses on doing by learning, putting into practice the concepts covered in semester 2-1.</p><p><img src=https://fabiankuo.github.io/asset-repo/Sem2-2_assignments.jpg alt="Semester 2-2 Assignments"></p><h2 id=week-1>Week 1</h2><p>A few APIs are provided, allowing us to practice reading API documents and using Axios to make ajax requests in Codepen. The main goal is to learn how to use an API in our project.</p><p>This week also introduces our first full fledge IDE, visual studio code. Installation directions and suggestions on what extensions to install are both provided.</p><p>Week 1 wraps up with a DOM manipulation practice session, improving up our previous to-do list project from semester 2-1 and creating a simple shopping cart web page.</p><h2 id=week-2>Week 2</h2><p>Week 2 focuses on writing functions and making API calls. The goal is to build a movie gallery web page with search, add to favorite, pagination, and the usage of the bootstrap modal. A complete walk-through is provided, guiding the learner to build this web page from the ground up. A recurring theme is divide and conquer, breaking down the problem into bite-size chunks. Throughout the coding process, we are reminded to use meaningful variables and function names and to keep functions as simple as possible, limiting their content to complete one specific task.</p><h2 id=week-3>Week 3</h2><p>This week is dedicated to writing our own web pages with the search, pagination, and add to favorite functions. We are encouraged to be creative with our web page, but at the same time to limit the scope of the project. This way, we&rsquo;ll be able to finish the project in time.</p><p>I built a website displaying a made up friend list. The user can filter the list by first and last name using the search bar. A tri-state toggle is also included for filtering. I extended the search functionality by adding multiple keyword support, meaning the user can filter their friend list with multiple keywords and remove these keywords as seen fit. I also extended the pagination function into a dynamic pagination function. This allows the user to navigate to either the previous or next page, the first or last page, or any page displayed in the pagination list. The pages displayed changes according to the number of pages and the current page.</p><h2 id=week-4>Week 4</h2><p>A lot of content is crammed into this week, including a card memorization game, an introduction to version control with git, git pages, and preparing for semester 2-3.</p><p>The card memorization game is designed to help the learner implement an MVC structure in javascript and to practice encapsulation.</p><p>The git section provides an installation walk-through and git command practices.</p><p>The remaining content introduces frontend and backend web development. Explaining the different perspectives and the differences in responsibilities. Learners are given an overview of the two different roles to help them decide whether to learn frontend or backend web development in semester 2-3.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Semester 2-2 is chock-full of practices. For some practices, a step by step walk-through is provided. These guided practices are then followed by another un-guided practice to reinforce the concepts covered in the previous practice. These exercises can be used to evaluate the learner&rsquo;s familiarity and ability to implement the covered concepts.</p><p>Depending on what functions the learner wants to realize in the practices, the time required for each practice may vary greatly from within an hour to days. The key here is to set clear goals and limit the scope of the practices according to each individual&rsquo;s abilities and schedule. In other words, expectation and time management are both crucial for completing semester 2-2.</p><p>Upon completing semester 2-2, the learner will have the skills to manipulate DOM, use bootstrap, apply css, and write javascript code. The learner would be well prepared to continue on their journey into either React or Node.js.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><p class=post-tags><span>Tagged:</span>
